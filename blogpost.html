        <h2>How to use 1Password to share local secrets</h2>
        <p>
          # devops # tutorial # javascript # productivity Author's Note: All the
          plain-text secret values shown in this tutorial are fictional. Don't
          try to use them to hack my things, btecause these resources do not
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          1Password is an excellent password manager, and recently I began
          exploring the value it can provide for secrets management, and boy is
          it easy! If your team is using 1Password, you can use your vaults to
          share secrets and pass them to your projects! Below is a tutorial I've
          documented as I tested this process myself.
        </p>
        <p>Prerequisites In order to follow this tutorial, you'll need:</p>
        <p>
          A 1Password cloud subscription. If you're using the legacy version of
          1Password where you self-host your vaults, this guide likely won't
          work. The 1Password CLI. You can find the installation docs here.
          <br />
          Optional: Create a vault <br />
          While this step is optional to complete the tutorial, it's a good
          practice to have your secrets and credentials organized in a way that
          segregates access. For this example, let's pretend our project is the
          following:
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript based SaaS Application <br />
          Engineering Team: <br />
          1 Principal Engineer <br />
          1 Senior-level Engineer <br />
          1 Junior-level Engineer <br />
          Two Environments <br />
          Non-Prod: Everyone has access <br />
          Production: Only Principal and Senior <br />
          Given this context, we'd want our Junior Engineer to be able to
          view/add/edit non-production secrets, but not production ones. Let's
          start by first creating a vault which is accessible by all engineers
          and call it NewApp Non-Prod:
        </p>

        <div>Image</div>

        <p>
          Add secrets to vault <br />
          Next, let's populate a few different credentials in this vault. For
          this tutorial, I'm going to keep things simple and create two
          different items. For our first item, let's create NewApp (Local). This
          is where I would put shared secrets that are owned by the application
          itself. In this example, I've defined a few items like URL, admin
          password, postgres connection string, token salt, and JWT Secret:
        </p>

        <p>
          Next let's add a second item to our vault for a third-party
          integration. For this example, we'll use the service Twilio and define
          our test Account SID and Auth Token which is used by the application
          at startup: Image description
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a .env-template file <br />
          Within your project, create a new file called .env-template, which
          we'll use as a template for creating a .env file used by the
          application at runtime. Let's scaffold our template by mapping out the
          environment variables our application requires:
        </p>
